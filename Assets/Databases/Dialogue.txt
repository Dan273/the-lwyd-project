"W-what was that? Hello?! Who's there?" \n (Everyone has left. Is someone still here?)
"Who's there? Mass has finished. You're not meant to be here!" \n (I'd better investigate the organ.)
"What's that music? It's getting closer..." \n (I should do what the note said.)
(I'm not staying here any longer. I didn't lock the main doors. I should leave there.)
(It won't open?! That's not possible! I need to try the side door. I hope Father Jones didn't lock it.)
(This must be for the side door that was mentioned... Is that music I hear? I'd better stay quiet.)
(It's locked, there must be a key around here somewhere...)
